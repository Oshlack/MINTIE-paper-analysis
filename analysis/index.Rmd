MINTIE: identifying novel structural and splice variants in transcriptomes using RNA-seq data
=============================================================================================

**MINTIE** is a **M**ethod for **I**nferring **N**ovel **T**ranscripts and **I**soforms using **E**quivalence classes. 

This site contains the code for generating the figures and analyses presented in the (upcoming) MINTIE paper.

Analysis
--------

* [Simulation Benchmarking](Simulation_Benchmarking.html) -- comparison of variants found by
  MINTIE and 7 other methods in a simulated data set of 1,500 variants.
